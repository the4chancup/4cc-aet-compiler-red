# the settings from the teams' kit config files and then included in the patch.

# previous seasons.
# Default: 1
bins_updating = 1

[Multi Cpk]

# you pack, until you delete the patches_contents folder yourself.
# Default: 1
cache_clear = 1

[Pause when Wrong]
# This setting is for pausing the compiler every time an error in the export is found.
# Even if disabled, a line with the team's name is added to the memelist.txt file, so that
# you can you can check all the problems after compiling is done.
# If this setting is on you can stop the compiler when an error is found and fix the export right
# away then restart the compiler, without the need to wait for it to be finished compiling first.
# Disable it if you want to leave your pc running unattended without ever stopping.
# Default: 1
pause_when_wrong = 1

[Pass-through Mode]
# This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers when making cup DLC.
# . Level 0 makes the compiler behave normally and run all the checks for errors in the exports.
# . Level 1 will skip any checks. This will make the extraction of exports run much more quickly,
#   but only use it on exports you have checked beforehand.
# The compiler will still check if the team name is present on the teams list.
# Default: 0
pass_through = 0

[Forced Admin Mode]
# This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.
# The compiler checks automatically if you need admin permissions or not depending on your
# pes install folder, but if despite that the compiler fails to move the cpks you can try
# forcing the request of admin permissions with this setting.
# Default: 0
admin_mode = 0
