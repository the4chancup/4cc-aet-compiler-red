29/09/25 - Version 4.1.0
- Important
  - Switched from the compiled exe to a folder containing embeddable Python,
    which still allows running the compiler without having to install Python but
    also avoids triggering false positives on antivirus software. The folder
    contains Python 3.13 instead of the 3.12 used in the exe, so the compiler
    will run even faster.
- Useful
  - Added support for NO_USE files in export folders. If an export folder
    contains a "NO_USE" or "NO_USE.txt" file, the compiler will skip it
    during the extraction process. This allows you to disable exports without
    having to move or delete them.
- Fixes
  - Added support for the new Commented Config Parser library (3.0.0), which
    was getting installed recently on new systems and which was glitching the
    comments on the settings file after updating across major versions.
  - Fixed the transferring of values across renamed settings during major
    updates. The Allow Pausing setting was not having its value transferred from
    the old Pause on Error setting.
  - Fixed crashes caused by the compiler using an unsupported exit function when
    trying to exit after giving a Fatal Error message.
  - Fixed crash when processing an export without any folders.
- Other stuff
  - Improved the First Run Wizard to show the currently set PES path (if Move
    Cpks mode is enabled) and let you change it if it's invalid.


26/09/25 - Version 4.0.0
- Important
  - The compiler now supports Referee exports, which are automatically converted
    to regular team exports then compiled into a separate referees cpk.
    (Check the advanced readme in the Engines folder for more details.)
  - Added official support for PES15.
    PES15 mode is almost the same as PES17 mode, but it automatically replaces
    the "uniform" model type on xmls with "uniform_sub" to prevent crashes.
    (More differences might be added in the future.)
  - The compiler now comes compiled (erm) into an exe file for Windows users.
    This means it can be run without having to install Python. It will also run
    slightly faster thanks to the tool (Nuitka) recompiling the code to C first.
  - As pre-announced, the check for unsupported file types now gives out an
    error instead of a warning, which means model folders with unsupported file
    types will be discarded. A Strict File Type Check setting has been added
    which allows turning this off.
- Useful
  - Introduced the "ingame_face" file, which allows having face folders with
    just a portrait for players with an ingame face, without their faces getting
    replaced with a blank model. Just create an empty txt file named
    "ingame_face.txt" in the face folder.
  - Automatic face xml generation now allows giving the model files you put
    in the face folders any model type you want, by simply naming them
    "[optional_]model_type_{type}.model" where {type} is the model type.
    For example, "dagumi_model_type_sleeve_sub.model" gets "sleeve_sub" as type.
  - Implemented merging onto custom face xmls of face_diff bin or xml files, if
    any are present in the same face folder.
  - Team IDs are now replaced inside every subfolder in every model folder and
    in the common folder, recursively.
- Fixes
  - Fixed the compiler crashing when processing exports which lack a Portraits
    folder and which also have a Faces folder none of whose folders contain a
    portrait.
  - Fixed portraits being wrongly converted to ftex on PES19 and PES21, and
    giving out name check errors as a consequence.
  - Fixed BC7 portraits not being converted to DXT5 on exports lacking a Faces
    folder.
  - Fixed bins updating crashing when a team entry on the teams list file has an
    empty name.
  - Fixed custom face xmls not having the team ID replaced in their contents.
  - Fixed some rare path issues when running the compiler on Linux.
  - Improved checking of model folder names to prevent crashes caused by names
    not containing numbers where they should.
  - Reduced the number of rename operations during packing of model folders to
    prevent crashes caused by overzealous antivirus software.
  - Added a fallback function which removes the readonly bit when failing to
    delete a temporary folder.
- New checks
  - Made the texture type check more robust, it now also tells you the real type
    of the textures it finds not to match their extension.
  - Added validation for uncompressed kit textures on pre-fox PES versions.
  - Added a check on startup to make sure the PES Version set is supported.
- Other new stuff
  - Renamed the Pause on Error setting to Allow Pausing. It now also covers
    every type of pause, not just error pausing. Fatal errors still pause the
    script regardless of this setting.
  - Improved the appearance and usefulness of crash messages and logs.
  - Improved the quality of textures converted from BC7 to DXT5 by using
    the -srgb flag on ImageMagick.
  - Added a new "First Run Wizard" which shows the currently set PES version and
    lets you change it on the fly.
  - Now supports Python 3.13 in addition to the already supported 3.12, although
    this only really matters if you are running it on Linux or running
    experimental versions (there's no exe for those).
  - The state files (e.g. update_check_last.txt) are now located in a new
    "state" folder, which is carried over when updating the compiler.
  - Updated the teams list file with the teams from VGL24.


22/12/24 - Version 3.5.0
- Fixed Linux compatibility issues.
- Fixed automatic conversion of BC7 textures to DXT5 when compiling for pre-fox
  PES versions (the quality is not great so it should be used as a last resort).
- Improved support for team note txts, mtls and xmls with special characters.
- Added replacing of team IDs on all the filenames in every folder.
- Added replacing of team IDs on mtls in the team's common folder, and replacing
  of any relative paths with absolute ones to the team's common folder.
- Added prompt when compiling a team export whose name is not listed on the
  teams list, which asks for the team ID to use and adds it to the teams list.


10/11/24 - Version 3.4.0
- Added replacing of team IDs on custom face xmls on pre-fox.
- Added support for paths which point to the default uniform/common/ folder of
  PES (instead of the team's subfolder).
- Forced the required python version to 3.12, some of the external libraries are
  not compatible with 3.13 yet.


12/10/24 - Version 3.3.1
- Set the default PES version to 17.
- Fixed issue with model files inside the common folder not being allowed on 17.
- Fixed error message shown when texture paths use default PES textures from the
  "uniform/common/" folder.
- Added error message shown when using file paths in the deprecated
  "common/teamname/" format instead of the new "common/XXX/" format.
- Fixed DX10 textures not being converted to DXT5 when compiling for 18 or lower
  if the "Pass Through" setting was enabled, or if they were zlibbed.


06/09/24 - Version 3.3.0
- Important
  - Added "shirt" and "pants_nocloth" to the list of .model types recognized
    when generating an xml for xml-less face folders on pre-fox.
  - The kit textures check now allows textures with sizes smaller than
    2048x2048, as long as the size of their sides is a power of 2.
- Fixes
  - Fixed issue with some texture paths inside fmdl models not having the team
    ID replaced.
  - Fixed the u0XXXg pattern on texture filenames not having its team ID
    replaced.
  - Fixed crash when trying to compile teams not listed on the teams list, when
    they do not have a note txt.
  - Fixed compiler not being able to install dependencies if the pip installer
    is missing, by making the compiler install pip first.
  - Fixed some special characters (like @) not being recognized on team names on
    exports without a note txt.
  - Fixed issue with diff xml getting accessed after it was deleted.
  - Fixed crash when any model folders with a unicode charcter on their name
    caused an issue or suggestion message.
- New checks
  - Checks if PES is open while running with "Move Cpks" enabled, and asks to
    close it then tries again.
  - Checks if any of the exports have more than one note txt file.
  - Checks if ImageMagick is installed on linux systems before starting.
  - Checks if any of the face folders have an unsupported "hair.xml" file.
  - Checks if any of the exports have duplicate IDs on face, boots and glove
    folders.
- Other new stuff
  - The PES version chosen for compiling is now shown at startup, with a
    different color for each version.
  - The error message shown when using ftex textures on pre-fox PES versions now
    shows the chosen PES version.
  - The check for whether the "Cpk Name" written on the settings file is present
    on the DpFileList file in the PES download folder is now active even if
    "Move Cpks" is disabled, but gives a warning instead of an error in this
    case.
  - When compiling the kit entries into the unicolor bin, the numbers of kits
    are now distinguished between outfielder kits (P) and GK kits (GK).
  - Added shebang line to compiler_main.py for linux users.
  - Color codes are no longer enabled on Windows versions below 10
    (They are not supported.)
  - When python is missing and the Windows version is 7, an alternative download
    link for a python release compatible with it is now opened instead.
  - The "extracted_exports" folder is now called "extracted".
  - Portrait conflicts (player with portrait in both its face folder and in the
    Portraits folder) will not lead to the export getting discarded anymore if
    both files are equal.


19/05/24 - Version 3.2.0
- Important
  - Updated the teams list file with the teams from VGL22.
  - The readme file has been split into a simple one in the main folder and an
    advanced one in the Engines folder, please read the simple one at least
    once.
  - Team IDs are now also replaced on the texture filenames which have u0XXXp0
    (or u0XXXg0) on them, both in model folders and in the common folder.
  - The same is done on the texture paths inside fmdl files.
  - Kit textures without a mask file (srm) will get a dummy one added when
    compiling for pre-fox PES versions.
    (This prevents the kits from turning black on some computers.)
  - Face folders without a face_diff.bin file will get a dummy one added, which
    has the EEEE hidden, when compiling for Fox PES versions
    (This allows you to use empty face folders on players with an FBM.)
    (Reminder: fpk.xml files are not needed anymore on face/boots/glove
    folders.)
- Fixes
  - Fixed crash when updating bins without a proper "PES Folder Path" set.
  - Fixed unzipping of zip and 7z exports again.
  - Fixed cleaning of read-only permissions on exports for linux.
  - Fixed crash when using bin files from a compressed bins cpk.
  - Fixed crash when moving models from the Collars folder of the export.
  - Fixed crashes caused by irregular team note txt files, to a certain extent.
  - Fixed non-DX10 textures getting converted to DXT5 instead of DX10 textures
    when compiling for PES18.
  - Fixed crash when handling ftex textures saved with the CGPE tool.
  - Fixed crash when moving kit configs on exports which have duplicate kit
    configs with different team IDs (for some reason).
- New checks
  - Checks for any unusable .model files in the boots and glove folders,
    preventing misnamed models.
  - Checks if model folders (face/boots/glove folders) contain any unrecognized
    files and warns about them.
    (In the future there will be a new setting, enabled by default, which will
    turn this into an error and discard the entire model folder.)
  - Checks if any compiler files are missing, and offers to "self-heal" them
    if possible.
  - Checks for portrait files without powers of two as sides.
  - Checks for non-2048 main kit textures on pre-fox PES versions.
  - Checks if any exports have duplicate kit configs with different team IDs.
  - Checks if the "Cpk Name" written on the settings file is present on the
    DpFileList file in the PES download folder.
- Other new stuff
  - A new message type has been added: Info.
    These are just suggestions, they let you know about stuff which will always
    work but isn't ideal, and which you can look into to improve your
    aesthetics. They will be written to the new suggestions.log file.
  - The missing mipmaps message is now an Info instead of a Warning.
  - A new message type has been added: Fatal Error.
    These happen when something is missing in the compiler's folder (for example
    the teams list) or is badly configured, so the compiler can't run.
  - The error.log file is now called crash.log, and your user name will be
    removed from it every time it is generated, so that you can post it without
    doxing yourself.
  - Stops asking for a button press to exit if "Run PES" is enabled
    (Unless there were any issues in the exports.)
  - Stops the loggers before asking for a button press to exit
    (This prevents crashes if you run the compiler again without closing it.)
  - Allows the terminal to close on error on linux systems.
  - The message for indicating an old version of python is installed has been
    improved, with more details on what to do to fix the problem.
  - Searches for bin files only on the cpks listed on the dpfl before the
    one you are about to compile, allowing to rebuild past midcup cpks properly.
  - Converts any DX10 textures (e.g. BC7 textures) to DXT5 when compiling for
    pre-fox PES versions, like done already for PES18.
  - Removes unrecognized files and folders from model folders when packing fpks
    for Fox PES versions.
  - Allows pressing any key to skip error messages or exit, instead of just
    the Enter key.
  - Boots and gloves are packed to the faces cpk instead of the uniform cpk
    when compiling for pre-fox PES versions, like done already for Fox versions.
  - The auto-updater has been improved with a new settings transfer function,
    used when updating to a new major version, which compares the old and new
    settings files and transfers as many settings as possible, warning about
    any new settings you need to pay attention to.


24/04/24 - Version 3.1.0
- Update checking is now much faster.
- New auto updating system, which downloads the new version and copies your
  stuff automatically.
- Now allows skipping the latest version, or disabling update checking
  directly from the compiler.
- Now looks inside the midcup cpks and the faces and uniform cpk for any files
  whose path (listed on mtl and xml files) points to the common folder of the
  team, which prevents the compiler from giving errors when processing barebone
  midcup exports.


23/04/24 - Version 3.0.2
- Added support for face folders with no mtl files, which would previously
  crash the compiler.
- Now removes the extracted_exports folder when starting, if it is present
  because of the compiler not closing cleanly after the previous run.


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.1
- Fixed crash at start when certain libraries were missing from the user's PC.


20/04/24 - Version 3.0.0
- Important
  - New teams_list txt with support for the new unified database.
  - Generates an error.log file after crashing, which you should provide when
    requesting support.
  - Generates an issues.log file after compiling, if any of the exports had any
    issues, with the list of warnings and errors.
  - Now checks mtl and xml pre-fox files for consistency, duplicated materials,
    and missing listed textures and model files.
  - Now allows pre-fox folders without an xml file (xml-less) and automatically
    generates an xml with the contents of the folder, this is required for
    properly compiling the exports converted by the 4cc-aet-converter tool.
- Fixes
  - Fixed unzlibbing of zlibbed textures.
  - Fixed unzipping of zip and 7z exports.
  - Fixed recognition of team names on exports without a Note txt.
  - Fixed errors when unpacking exports with read-only files or folders.
- Other new stuff
  - When a pre-fox face folder without a model set as "face_neck" is found, a
    dummy model will be copied to the folder and added to the xml, to prevent
    the default PES neck from showing up on the player .
  - Will give an error if any players have a portrait both in their face folder
    and in the Portraits folder.
  - A few new texture checks have been added (powers of 2, mipmaps, too small).
  - The Pes Path setting now accepts a ** magic number, which gets automatically
    replaced with the Pes Version number, eliminating the need to change both
    every time you switch versions.
  - New setting for opening PES automatically after packing the cpk, disabled by
    default.
  - Now suppports Note txt files in UTF8 format, weird symbols are now allowed.
  - Team IDs now get replaced even in the texture paths inside mtl files,
    necessary for supporting kit-dependent player-specific textures (u0XXXp0).
  - Team IDs are also replaced in the textures' filenames themselves.
  - The DDS Compression feature has been reintroduced, useful for making a full
    cup DLC that won't take 10GB on the drive.
  - For Bins Updating, it will automatically grab the bin files from the latest
    midcup cpk (or the Bins cpk if none were found), eliminating the need to
    share the bin files when someone else has to make some midcup cpks.
  - Now checks for updates straight from github every time it's started, with a
    cooldown of 2 hours.


19/03/24 - Version 2.0.0
- Fixed some issues with packing fpk and cpk files.
- Converted the main compiler runner to python to allow move_cpks to work
  properly when admin rights are needed.
- Converted the settings file to ini format to allow the above to work.
- Added new cache_clear setting (on by default) to allow deleting the
  patches_contents folder every time a cpk is packed.


16/03/24 - Version 1.0.0
- Converted almost all of the code to python.
  (Some bugs might be present, please report them with screenshots).
- Merged the fox settings into a new pes version setting.
- Removed the setting for outputting compressed cpks.
- Removed the module for zlibbing all the textures.
- Removed the dpfl appender.
  (Please never modify your dpfl.)
- Updated the python version checker to have it check for 3.12+.
- Updated the texture checker to have it check for the DXT type and the ftex
  version when the PES version is set to 18.
