# 4cc aet compiler Red 3.X.X - Settings file

# Lines starting with # are comment lines and will be ignored by the compiler.
# 1 means enabled, 0 means disabled.

[PES Version]
# Set the destination version of Pro Evolution Soccer.
# Accepted values: 16 - 17 - 18 - 19 - 21
# Default: 17
pes_version = 17

[Cpk Name]
# (Only edit this setting if absolutely necessary.)
# Write the filename used for the generated cpk, without quotes.
# The maximum filename length you can set here is 28 characters.
# Default: 4cc_90_test
cpk_name = 4cc_90_test

[Move Cpks]
# If enabled, the cpks created will be moved to the PES' download folder.
# If disabled, the cpks will be put inside a "patches_output" folder in the
# compiler's main folder.
# Default: 1
move_cpks = 1

[PES Folder Path]
# (This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled, or if Bins
# Updating is enabled.)
# Set the path to the PES folder, without any quotes.
# If PES is installed in a system folder (like the default Program Files),
# the compiler will ask for admin permissions every time you run it.
# The ** magic number, if used, will be replaced by the PES Version number
# automatically.
pes_folder_path = C:\Program Files (x86)\Pro Evolution Soccer 20**

[Bins Updating]
# If enabled, the UniColor and TeamColor files will be automatically updated
# with entries taken from the teams' txt files.
# If the PES Version is 18 or higher, the UniformParameter file will also be
# updated with the settings from the teams' kit config files.
# For the above, the compiler will look for bin files inside every midcup cpk
# inside the PES download folder (if properly set), then, if no midcup cpks had
# bin files, inside the Bins cpk. If found, the compiler will use those as a
# base for the updated bins, otherwise default bins will be used.
# Updating the bins should only be disabled if your team has the same amount of
# kits as in the previous competitions.
# Default: 1
bins_updating = 1

[Run PES]
# (This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.)
# If enabled, PES will be started right after packing the cpks.
# The PES exe must have the filename "PES20**.exe", where ** is the PES Version,
# and must be located in the PES Folder Path.
# Default: 0
run_pes = 0

[Multi Cpk]
# (This setting is usually only needed when making cup DLC.)
# If enabled, the compiler will create various cpks for a proper DLC:
# . Faces cpk: Faces, Portraits, Boots, Gloves, Common stuff
# . Uniform cpk: Kit Textures, Kit Configs, Logos
# . Bins cpk: Bin files (UniColor, TeamColor, UniformParameter)
# You can also set their names here (The Cpk Name setting, used for the single
# cpk mode, will be ignored).
# Default: 0
multicpk_mode = 0
faces_cpk_name = 4cc_40_faces
uniform_cpk_name = 4cc_45_uniform
bins_cpk_name = 4cc_08_bins

[DDS Compression]
# (This setting is only considered if the PES Version is 17 or lower.)
# (This setting is usually only needed when making cup DLC.)
# If enabled the compiler will use zlib compression on all DDS textures after
# checking and processing the exports.
# Default: 0
dds_compression = 0

[Cache Clearing]
# If enabled, the "patches_contents" folder will be deleted after packing the
# cpks.
# If disabled, the exports you've compiled previously will be included in
# every cpk you pack, until you delete the "patches_contents" folder yourself.
# Default: 1
cache_clear = 1

[Pause on Error]
# If enabled, the compiler will pause every time an error in the export is
# found, so you can stop it and fix the export right away then restart the
# compiler, without waiting for it to be finished compiling first.
# Even if disabled, a line with the team's name is added to the log.txt file,
# so that you can you can check all the problems after compiling is done.
# Disable it if you want to leave your pc running unattended without ever
# stopping.
# Default: 1
pause_on_error = 1

[Pass-through]
# (This setting is usually only needed when making cup DLC.)
# If enabled, the compiler will skip any checks. This will make the compiling of
# exports run more quickly, but only use it on exports you have checked
# beforehand.
# The compiler will still check if the team name is present on the teams list.
# Default: 0
pass_through = 0

[Admin Forcing]
# (This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.)
# If enabled, admin permissions will be requested even if the compiler does not
# think the PES folder is in a system folder.
# Use this if the compiler fails to move the cpks after compiling.
# Default: 0
admin_mode = 0

[Updates Checking]
# (This setting is only considered on Windows systems.)
# If enabled, the compiler will check if a newer version of the compiler
# exists on the github repository every time it is run. If a newer version
# exists, an update message will be displayed.
# After checking, the compiler won't check again for the following two hours.
# Default: 1
updates_check = 1
